FindSDL3

Locate SDL3 library

This module defines the following 'IMPORTED' targets:

::

  SDL3::Core
    The SDL3 library, if found.
    Libraries should link to SDL3::Core

  SDL3::Main
    The SDL3main library, if found.
    Applications should link to SDL3::Main instead of SDL3::Core



This module will set the following variables in your project:

::

  SDL3_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
  SDL3_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find SDL.h
  SDL3_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL3
  SDL3MAIN_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL3main
  SDL3_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL3



This module responds to the following cache variables:

::

  SDL3_PATH
    Set a custom SDL3 Library path (default: empty)

  SDL3_NO_DEFAULT_PATH
    Disable search SDL3 Library in default path.
      If SDL3_PATH (default: ON)
      Else (default: OFF)

  SDL3_INCLUDE_DIR
    SDL3 headers path.

  SDL3_LIBRARY
    SDL3 Library (.dll, .so, .a, etc) path.

  SDL3MAIN_LIBRAY
    SDL3main Library (.a) path.

  SDL3_BUILDING_LIBRARY
    This flag is useful only when linking to SDL3_LIBRARIES insead of
    SDL3::Main. It is required only when building a library that links to
    SDL3_LIBRARIES, because only applications need main() (No need to also
    link to SDL3main).
    If this flag is defined, then no SDL3main will be added to SDL3_LIBRARIES
    and no SDL3::Main target will be created.


Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m in your project for the
OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDL3main which
this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.


Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL3_LIBRARY in your project
configuration, it means CMake did not find your SDL3 library
(SDL3.dll, libsdl3.so, SDL3.framework, etc). Set SDL3_LIBRARY to point
to your SDL3 library, and  configure again. Similarly, if you see an
empty SDL3MAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as appropriate. These
values are used to generate the final SDL3_LIBRARIES variable and the
SDL3::Core and SDL3::Main targets, but when these values are unset,
SDL3_LIBRARIES, SDL3::Core and SDL3::Main does not get created.


$SDL3DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDL3DIR used in building SDL3.  l.e.galup 9-20-02



Created by Amine Ben Hassouna:
  Adapt FindSDL.cmake to SDL3 (FindSDL3.cmake).
  Add cache variables for more flexibility:
    SDL3_PATH, SDL3_NO_DEFAULT_PATH (for details, see doc above).
  Mark 'Threads' as a required dependency for non-OSX systems.
  Modernize the FindSDL3.cmake module by creating specific targets:
    SDL3::Core and SDL3::Main (for details, see doc above).


Original FindSDL.cmake module:
  Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
  by using environmental variables and providing a more
  controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
  recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
  Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
  guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
  platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
  platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.

On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache value of SDL3_LIBRARY to
override this selection or set the SDL3_PATH variable or the CMake
environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
"SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
